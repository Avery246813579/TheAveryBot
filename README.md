# TheAveryBot
TheAveryBot is a IRC Bot that I used to monitor and play games in Twitch.Tv chat rooms. We used Java to connect to our Twitch
chat rooms and we used SQL and get which chat rooms our bot had to monitor, and to store all our users information. 

Not included in this repo is the website (powered on PHP and used SQL) I had that Twitch Streamers could connect to and alter their bots configurations.
